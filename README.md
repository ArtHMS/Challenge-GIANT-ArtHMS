# Challenge-GIANT

Following to the documentation, was possible implemented a soluction for the problem descript. Where the challenge is to identify the most profitable period from the beginning of 2000 to beginning of March/2021.

We will now follow the code step by step to solve the problem:


Imports:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ca2a877-5f53-47d3-9262-3235bbaedff0)

 
The main thing is to import pandas and requests:

 
 --  Pandas library for data conversion and formatting. In addition to reading, filtering, calculating and generating structured outputs.
 
 --  Requests is used to fetch data from an online API, specifically the Central Bank of Brazil API, which provides Selic rate data.


 “CarregadorSelic” Class:

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af3f600-b6c3-4e40-ba45-88306795f1ca)


 --  The “CarregadorSelic” Class, causes the API URL to be automatically set to specified date range.


 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/357e79a4-bc7f-4aec-9afe-5d95f9640936)

 -- 	Defines the __init__ constructor method that will be called when a new instance of the class is created.
 --  Accepts two optional parameters, start_date and end_date, with default values of ‘01/01/2000’ and ‘03/01/2021’.


 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/219c98c2-86e6-46b6-80e9-22b35fd8cc5e)

 --  These three code snippets initialize the “start_date and end_date” attributes and configure the Selic API URL based on the dates provided.


 <br/><br/>

 “Buscar_dados_selic” Method:

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2543a064-150b-4ca2-b660-87cc19afaf3a)


 --  The “Buscar_dados_selic” method makes an HTTP GET requests to the API URL stored in self.url_selic. If the requests is successful (status code 200), it returns the data in JSON format. Otherwise, it raises an exception.

 
<br/>

“Processar_dados_selic” Method:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa8a719-9087-48db-9c7c-2fffa0b6d33c)

--  The “Processar_dados_selic” Method transforms Selic API data into a Pandas DataFrame, with the date column converted to date format and the value column converted to float and adjusted to by scale (divided by 100).



<br/>

“Obter_dataframe_selic” Method:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f26824db-0314-42e3-a61a-cf04d9d023ca)

--  The “Obter_dataframe_selic” method encapsulates the logic of fetching, searching and returning Selic data in an organized and efficient way.


<br/>

“Calcular_valor_ganho” Method:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbaa7195-c684-4b4c-b9be-527212759440)

--  The “Calcular_valor_ganho” method is designed to calculate the value gained from invested capital over a specific period, using daily Selic rates.


<br/>

“Calcular_melhor_perido” Method:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d48741-43e6-4ad6-aba4-91b701d1b023)


--  Using “calcular_melhor_periodo”. It is possible to identify which maximizes capital gains based on the Selic rate.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b4ae639-c548-4de0-a534-fd5e2328d972)

--  If the gain calculated for the current period (gain_value) is greater than best_value, the method updates best_start, best_end and best_value with the values corresponding to the current period.

--  After going through all possible periods, the method returns the start and end dates of the best period, along with the maximum gain value found.


<br/>

“Calcular_ganhos_frequencia” Method

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a41499a3-4ec2-4184-9855-3b306870ec5a)

--	The methods presented allow calculating the accumulated gains from invested capital based on Selic rates, at different frequencies (daily, monthly, annual). The main methodcalcul_ganhos_frequencia performs the following steps:

  -	Gets Selic data.
  -	Sets the date column as the index and resamples the data according to the specified frequency.
  -	Calculates the accumulated value and the earned value.
  -	Resets the index and renames the columns to a more readable format.
  -	Returns a DataFrame containing the accumulated capital and the earned amount.


<br/>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3a9dffb-6b28-49cc-a844-186c96defd32)

-- This code snippet demonstrates how to use the methods of a CarregadorSelic class to calculate and display capital gains based on Selic rates at different frequencies (daily, monthly, annual). It also identifies the best period to invest to maximize capital gains. The process includes initializing the object with a date range, calculating and displaying earnings, and identifying the best period for investment.

<br/>

The output shown is generated by the code snippet where daily, monthly and annual earnings are calculated and printed. I'll explain where exactly this happens and what each part of the output means.

The output is generated by this piece of code in the main block (if __name__ == '__main__'):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99fffcec-f9ad-43bc-afc0-0e7fa5ef23f6)

This code demonstrates how to calculate and display the daily, monthly and annual earnings of an investment based on Selic rates, using a CarregadorSelic class. The code output shows the first five lines of the calculated gains for each frequency.

The presented output, which includes the best day to invest, arguments used and detailed data in a DataFrame, is generated in the main block of code.

Excerpt from the Responsible Code:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfece331-cf02-4d20-8e1c-496f72479c18)

The code calculates the daily, monthly and annual earnings of an investment based on Selic rates, finds the best 500-day period to invest, and displays the results. The delay in execution is due to the large number of calculations performed on the extensive DataFrame and the iteration process to find the best investment period.

<br/>

EXTRA!

- Objective: Test the Central Bank of Brazil API to obtain Selic time series data.
- GET Request: Sends a GET request to the provided URL.
- Response Handling: Checks whether the response was successful and attempts to decode the JSON. Otherwise, it handles and displays errors.
- Execution: If the script is executed directly, the test_api function will be called to    perform the test.

This code is useful for verifying API connectivity and functionality before integrating Selic data into a larger project.

With this, the entire code example is completed using the programming skills allowed to solve the problem (bug). The challenge allowed me to test recent tools and libraries that will certainly help me in future projects.
